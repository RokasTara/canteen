This is a web application using the Flask framework for a school canteen where canteen managers are able to create daily menus and generate ordering forms for students which could be filled online.
The application generates PDF reports, has authentication, users with different permissions, tokens for password resetting, and uses SQLite database. SQLAlchemy was used which is an Object Relational Mapper toolkit that converts Python functions into SQL and converts Object classes into relational tables on the SQLite database.
